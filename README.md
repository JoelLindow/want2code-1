# Want2Code

A collaborative Rails project for the sake of learning concepts in:
- Authentication and Authorization
- CRUD
- Rails
- Better Git Workflow
- Building a meaningful real-world application

### To play with on your local machine:
* Clone Down Repo
* `bundle` or `bundle install`
* `rails s` to spin up a local server
* visit `localhost:3000/` in your browser / client window to create an account, learn about the founders, about the project and to play with the rest of the application

#### Thanks for looking. Keep on coding!
